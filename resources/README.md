# Pro Tips!

As emailed to the csgrads list in September 2011:

> Also a quick note: the grad office is very nit-picky about bibliography
appearance and on top of that they have *no idea* what LaTeX is, so that
can really make you lose your mind while trying to explain a particular
bibliography appearance (they ask style-guide proofs for everything).

> Somethings I am being punished for --

> 1. Different URL font (texttt) in bibliography
2.  Not having volume or issue number for "conferences" (because they
don't know that conferences proceedings don't have volume or issue number).
3. Page number format -- because they don't know what BibTeX is and are
asking me to provide proofs that this is the correct format (although I
tried to explain that I have not manipulated anything out of my own mind
and everything is done automatically by BibTeX and LaTeX)!
4. Having "c" of conference non-capitalized when the word "conference"
does not appear as a proper name of the conference..

> The list goes on.. but this is the glimpse.. so beware and plan your
dissertation submission accordingly!

> I wish the CS grad students who went through this trauma earlier had
alerted everyone else, but better late than never!

> The best way (as I have learnt the hard way) to submit your dissertation
is -- print it on the normal pages, take it to OGE, let it remain with
them for couple of weeks or more (that's how long they take to approve),
and after they are done with all their demands, you can print on the
acid-free cotton paper and submit finally.

> The worst thing you want to do is submit the dissertation, move out of
the town, and then "defend" your dissertation *printed copy* once again
to the OGE (after you are done defending the content to your committee
during your real defense)! :(

> Just an alert!

- Expect that after you submit your thesis, there will be requests for revision.  Incorporate this into your planning.  Do not immediately leave town, or if you do leave town, leave a supply of thesis paper with a friend who can submit the revised pages to the Office of Graduate Education for you.
- Many students submit theses, and each thesis has many pages.  Each page is reviewed.  It takes time to review all these pages.  It will take time before you will be notified of any requested revisions.
- Before you submit your thesis on bond paper, make an appointment with Celia Paquette in the Office of Graduate Education to review a draft of your thesis on regular paper.  
- The meeting with Celia may reduce, not eliminate, later requests for revision.
- Earlier is better, both for the draft review with Celia, and for the submission on bond paper.  If possible, submit the thesis before the deadline.
- Before you submit the thesis, you should have already submitted a Plan of Study form and a committee nomination form.  If you are  a PhD student, you also should have submitted a candidacy form.  Everything listed on your Plan of Study must match what you actually took. 
- Review the appropriate checklist: http://gradoffice.rpi.edu/update.do?artcenterkey=6 for MS, or http://gradoffice.rpi.edu/update.do?artcenterkey=5 for PhD.
- While requests for deadline extensions are not encouraged, if you must submit such a request, do so well in advance, and not in the week before the deadline.
- Make sure that your title page is correct before getting it signed.  Make sure that all committee members sign in black ink.
- Be consistent throughout your thesis with regard to font size, figures captions, alignment, delimiters, etc.  
- Adhere consistently to your chosen citation and reference style.
- Attribute your own work if it has been previously published.
- Appropriately attribute any figures or tables you get from another source.
- Make sure all text and images are within the required margins.

As emailed to csgrads in September 2014:


1. The research qualifying exam form is at http://www.cs.rpi.edu/academics/grad/researchqual.pdf.  This is a department requirement, so it's more laidback than some of the other requirements.  You just need the signatures of three faculty members, but it's okay if the signatures are not original signatures.

2. The committee nomination form is at http://www.rpi.edu/dept/grad/docs/Nomination_Form.PDF. Your committee will consist of at least 3 CS faculty members and at least one outside member.  This form requires original signatures of all your committee members.  The outside member may be outside RPI, or an RPI faculty member outside the CS Department.  If your outside member is outside RPI, a c.v. and letter of justification are also needed.  The committee form takes time, both for you to collect the signatures, and for OGE to review the form.  It is a good idea to start working on the form a semester in advance of your candidacy. You may not take your candidacy exam until your committee has been approved by OGE.  It is not enough to submit the form.  You have to wait until you get a document back from OGE saying that they have approved your committee.

3. The candidacy form is at http://www.rpi.edu/dept/grad/docs/Candidacy%20Exam%20Form-RCR.pdf. This form requires original signatures from all your committee members. The committee members who sign your candidacy form must be the same members who were approved by OGE on your committee form.
